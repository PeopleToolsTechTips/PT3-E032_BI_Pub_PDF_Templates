BI Publisher can populate PDF Forms with information from your database.  Some of these forms are business or industry related while many of them are official government forms.

BI Publisher enables your system to populate data on the actual PDF form instead of creating and maintaining a separate, custom versions of that form as an RTF template.  The savings in time and resources can be enormous. 

This also eliminates the need for third party services that do nothing more than take your data and place it on approved government forms.   You have this ability in house with BI Publisher.
